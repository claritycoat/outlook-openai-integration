2. Add description and choose expiration
3. **Copy the secret value immediately**

### OpenAI API Key (2 minutes)

1. Go to [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Create new API key
3. Copy the key (starts with `sk-`)

## Step 3: Configure Environment

Edit the `.env` file with your credentials:

```env
CLIENT_ID=your_azure_client_id
CLIENT_SECRET=your_azure_client_secret
TENANT_ID=your_azure_tenant_id
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

## Step 4: Test Your Setup

python test_setup.py
```

This will verify everything is working correctly.

## Step 5: Run the Integration

```bash
python outlook_openai_integration.py
```

Or use the launcher:

```bash
python run.py
```

## What Happens Next

1. The integration will scan your inbox every 15 minutes
2. For each unread email, it generates a professional draft response
3. Drafts are created in your Outlook Drafts folder
4. Processed emails are marked as read

## Troubleshooting

### "Authentication failed"
- Check your Azure App Registration credentials
- Ensure admin consent was granted for permissions

### "No emails processed"
- Check if emails are actually unread
- Verify domain filtering settings

### "OpenAI API error"
- Verify your OpenAI API key
- Check your OpenAI account balance

## Need Help?
