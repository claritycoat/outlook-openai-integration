# How the Updated System Works

## Overview

The system now creates draft responses for **ALL emails up to 4 days old** that haven't been replied to. This is perfect for people who struggle with inbox management and don't always move emails after replying.

## Email Processing Logic

### 1. Email Discovery
- **Scans emails** from the last 7 days
- **Filters to emails** up to 4 days old
- **Checks if you've already replied** to each email
- **Checks if a draft already exists** for each email

### 2. Draft Creation Rules

| Email Age | Action | Response Style |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| **0 days** (new today) | Create draft immediately | Prompt, professional response |
| **1-4 days** | Create draft if no reply | Acknowledges delay, apologizes |
| **4+ days** | Ignore (too old) | No action |

### 3. Duplicate Prevention

The system prevents creating multiple drafts for the same email by:
- **Checking your Drafts folder** for existing responses
- **Looking for reply patterns** in your sent emails
- **Only creating one draft per email**

## Response Types

### For New Emails (0 days old)
```
Subject: Re: [Original Subject]
Content: Prompt, professional response that:
- Acknowledges the email immediately
- Addresses questions/concerns
- Maintains professional tone
- Includes proper greeting/closing
```

### For Older Emails (1-4 days old)
```
Subject: Re: [Original Subject]
Content: Response that:
- Acknowledges the delay (e.g., "Thank you for your email from 3 days ago")
- Apologizes for the late response
- Addresses the original content
- Maintains professional tone
- Includes proper greeting/closing
```

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New Email (Same Day)
- **Email received**: "Can you help with my project?"
- **System action**: Creates immediate draft
- **Draft response**: "Thank you for reaching out! I'd be happy to help with your project. Could you share more details about what you need?"

### Scenario 2: 2-Day-Old Email
- **Email received**: "Following up on our meeting"
- **System action**: Creates draft with delay acknowledgment
- **Draft response**: "Thank you for your email from 2 days ago. I apologize for the delay in responding. Regarding our meeting..."

### Scenario 3: Already Replied
- **Email received**: "Meeting request"
- **Your action**: You already replied
- **System action**: No draft created (detects your reply)

### Scenario 4: Draft Already Exists
- **Email received**: "Project update needed"
- **System action**: Previously created draft
- **Result**: No new draft (prevents duplicates)

## Benefits for Inbox Management

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
